         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19262:76"/> willing to bee abſent from it, and to bee preſent with the Lord: Oh how eaſie is his yoke vnto mee now, and how light his burden, his Commandements are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger grieuous, but they are become the <hi>Ioy, and reioycing of my heart;</hi> whereas ſometimes I was obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and rebellious, and onely what I did, was compelled by the terrors of God which made mee affraide: and when I was reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for ſwearing, lying, breaking of the Saboth, neglecting vtterly the worſhippe of God, and ſuch like, it makes me to bluſh in ſecret: when I doe but thinke of my folly, and ignorance, with theſe I alſo am ſtayed to depend vpon God in all trialles, and to waite for an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: yea, I can beare any thing through the <hi>ſweete Hope,</hi> and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed expectation of a good ende
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19262:77"/> which the Lord will make: yea, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpell of Chriſt, becauſe I can waite for the Saluation that it bringeth.</hi> Beſides theſe, I haue ſuch wonderfull <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> as cannot bee expreſſed with Pen, whereas before the ſhaking of a leafe, would put me in feare: and great men would affright me with their high wordes. But now I feare them not, for I knowe they ſhall die and fade as graſſe: neither can the greateſt oppreſſor touch one haire of my head for hurt. <hi>As for death, it is ſwallowed vp in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by my</hi> Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And whereas formerly I was ledde vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to the committing of ſinne, and luſt did raigne in me: yea ſinne had dominion ouer mee, and I like a baſe Captiue, bound hand and foote, not able to reſiſt, did yeelde the ſeruice of my members to ſin:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19262:77"/> yea had not God in his aboundant mercy holden mee, I had broken foorth into all foule ſinnes. But here behold the wonderfull mercy of God! and vnſpeakeable louing kindneſſe! I haue gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Yea I can with comfort ſay; <hi>O Death where is thy ſting!</hi> Yea, <hi>I liue no more, but Chriſt Ieſus liueth in mee.</hi> The ſtrong man is caſt out, and the ſtronger hath taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion neuer to be diſpoſſeſſed. I am now his Freeman, he hath reſiſted the Diuell, crucified the fleſh, and ouercome the world for me. Yea, olde things are paſſed away, and all things are become newe, and I knowe my ſelfe to be in Chriſt, by that I am a newe creature. And when I take a viewe of my <hi>Folly, and ignorance,</hi> how brutiſh I haue beene, it doeth euen couer mee
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19262:78"/> with bluſhing, and ſhame: and when withall I doe call to minde, what <hi>aboundance of wiſedome</hi> I haue obtained ſince Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my <hi>wiſedome,</hi> yea when I conſider Gods wonderfull libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, in opening to me his treaſury of <hi>wiſedome and knowledge:</hi> and bidding mee aske what I will: this doeth many times amaze me, and wonderfully aſtoniſh mee, that ſo vile a perſon as I am, ſhould bee truſted with <hi>Treaſures of ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and Pearles of ſuch price:</hi> I doe thinke thus with my ſelfe, what am I? that I ſhould be ſo regarded, as that my mouth ſhould be made a Well of Life? my lippes ſhould know what is acceptable, that they ſhould feede many: and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould ſeeke the Lawe at my mouth? That ſuch <hi>Wiſedome and Spirit</hi> ſhould be giuen me, that all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19262:78"/> mine aduerſaries ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gainſay, or reſiſt; oh bleſſed be my God for euermore! oh let my tongue neuer ceaſe to ſound foorth his prayſes, and to tell of his louing kindneſſe from day to day. And when I looke without me, me thinkes the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> doeth rauiſh me, the <hi>feruent Loue,</hi> which we haue amongſt our ſelues, whereas I was once a <hi>companion of Murderers:</hi> ſuch I meane, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly would breake out into <hi>anger, wrath and rage, diſcloſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, breake couenants, carry tales to ſhedde blood,</hi> amongſt whom, though I ſometimes bleſſed my ſelfe, yet was my condition feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for I could expect nothing but death euery day, ſuch was the vncertaintie of any ſtaiedneſſe in their familiaritie.</p>
            <p>But now I am a <hi>Companion of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19262:79"/> Sonnes of Peace:</hi> All my Familiars are <hi>Peacemakers,</hi> wee are one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Keepers, Many wholeſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Louing inſtructions, and Amiable reprooffes,</hi> doe paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs.</p>
            <p>Manie are the feruent <hi>Prayers,</hi> we put vp one for another: yea, all that wee haue, we account not our owne, in one anothers neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>Our Loue is not in word, and in Tongue, but in deed, and in Truth It is continually increaſed, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily Flouriſh: Oh what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is it to meete in great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in the time of <hi>Peace;</hi> to heare the Word! break Bread togither! and to ioyne in heartie prayers and praiſes to our louing Father! Alſo, I now doe plainly ſee, that we haue <hi>more with vs, then againſt vs;</hi> For I was wont to conſider of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of wicked men in the world,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19262:79"/> and how they bandie themſelues, and conſpire againſt the Saintes, but now I ſee their attempts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weake: for wee haue our Seate on high, and are compaſſed round, with a <hi>Wall of Fyre: yea, the Angels of God, as Chariots of Fire, and Horſes of Fyre, doe compaſſe vs round continually:</hi> Yea, they alſo beholde our Fathers face in Heauen, readie to execute vengeance on our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes, and to beare vs in theyr hands, that wee hurt not our foote againſt a ſtone.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the Creatures were at enmitie with me, <hi>the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, in theyr courſes,</hi> the Earth would haue ſwallowed, the Water drowned, the Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed me: yea, the Winde would haue throwne downe Trees, and Houſes vpon mee: the very ſtones of the Fielde were at oddes with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19262:80"/> mee, the Beaſts, Fowles, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things at variance.</p>
            <p>The Corne, Wine, and Oyle, theſe did (as it were) diſdaine or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to yeeld me ſtrength: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now on the contrarie, the ſweete Familiaritie which is betweene vs, is exceeding great.</p>
            <p>The Sunne will not hurt me by day, nor the Moone by night: the <hi>Heauens,</hi> doe as it were ſmyle vpon mee: the Fire warmes me: the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeelds me moyſture: the Earth habitation: the Ayre, refreſhing: What ſhall I ſay? Mee thinkes, <hi>I ſee the Fire comming from Heauen:</hi> the Water preparing, the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening wide her mouth: the Ayre threatning: yea, all the Creatures muſtering themſelues: and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall readineſſe, to execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon ſuch, as ſhal euer dare to touch me for hurt.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:19262:80"/>
            <p>And all theſe are accompanyed with aboundance, of all neceſſaries for my ſelfe and my children: and whereas before I was in continuall want, in the midſt of plenty: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer caring for more, though I had enough: Now haue I abundance of all thinges with gteat Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that hundred fold gaine by Godlineſſe, yea, I can truely ſay, I can be abaſed, and I can abounde, I haue learned in what eſtate ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, therewith to be content. Yea, I know that I ſhall neuer want any thing that is good: neyther ſhall my children beg their bread.</p>
            <p>And when to this I can adde the ſure continuance of this eſtate, and doe knowe that I ſhall neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, neither is my eſtate ſubiect to Change: but I ſhall increaſe, not decreaſe: growe, not dye: goe forwards, not backwards, flouriſh,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19262:81"/> decay; and that I am in Chriſt, as ſtable, firme, and vnmooueable, as God is ſtable, firme, and vnmooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, this doeth ſo rauiſh me with comfort, that it drawes teares from mine eyes, I cannot but <hi>reioyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</hi> And yet further, when I thinke on my eſtate to come, at that day, which will be a dreadfull day to the wicked. I finde that all this which I haue cald to minde is very little, yea ſcarſe a handfull of the whole ſand of the Sea, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that bleſſedneſſe then to bee receiued. Then when our glorious Lord, the Lord of Glory, ſhall deſcend from Heauen with a ſhout, with the voyce of an Arch-angell, and which the Trumpe of God: when hee ſhall come moſt gloriouſly, in his owne Glory, his fathers Glory, and the Glory of all his holy and mightie Angels:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19262:81"/> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with tenne thouſands of his Saints in flaming fire to be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them. When he ſhal ſit vpon the throne of his Glory, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall bee gathered before him, and he ſhal ſeperate them one from another, as the ſhepherd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth his ſheepe from the Goates: and hauing ſet the ſheepe on his right hand; then ſhall this King of Glory, ſay vnto them on his right hand: <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherite the Kingdome prepared for you, from the foundations of the world,</hi> Then ſhall I with the reſt of Gods redeemed ones, paſſe away with great triumph, and in a glorious manner, enter <hi>thoſe heauenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of <hi>my euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting habitation.</hi> There, <hi>I ſhall ſee God face, to face:</hi> Yea I ſhall know him, euen as I am knowen: Then ſhall I be like him, for I ſhall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19262:82"/> ſee him, as he is. And when this my corruptible body hath put on Incorruption: and this Mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hath put on immortalitie: then ſhal be fully and perfectly brought to paſſe, for mee and all the elect, that which before was truely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <hi>That death is ſwallowed vp in victory.</hi> And will not this bee a wonderfull and moſt glorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate! when I ſhall ſhine foorth as the Sunne in his greateſt glitter: and moſt glorious brightneſſe? when I ſhall bee as the <hi>Angels in Heauen,</hi> alwaies beholding the face God, <hi>Where I ſhall haue no compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but glorified Saints, and bleſſed Patriarches, holy Prophets, glorious Apoſtles, triumphing Martyrs, chaſt Virgins, louing Angels!</hi> Where I ſhall haue plentie without want, health without ſickneſſe, honour without diſgrace, peace without
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19262:82"/> trouble, ſtrength without weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, courage without feare, loue without hatred, ioy without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, light without darkneſſe, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie without deformity, ſafety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger; knowledge without ignorance, life without death, all good without any euill: Yea this bleſſednes is ſo great, that the more I conceiue of it, the ſhorter I come to comprehend it. Yea if it were poſſible that the glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the meaneſt Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, were to bee knowen vnto the Sons of men, it would rauiſh them ſo, as that there would remaine no ſpirit in them: ſo wonderfully would it aſtoniſh and amaze them, oh how bleſſed then is my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! may a child of God ſay; <hi>That of one ſo poore, I ſhall be ſo inriched: of baſe, I ſhould become ſo honourable; of deſpiſed, ſo reſpected: of deformed,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19262:83"/> ſo beautifull, ſo oppreſſed, perſecuted, and afflicted: ſo free, ſo glorious and triumphant a Conquerour!</hi> And am not I then in a moſt bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath not God dealt richly with me? by whoſe ſpirit I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded firmely of ſuch <hi>Happineſſe;</hi> of which I haue already taſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly? yea my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if there were no other, I would not exchaunge with the Crownes of all the Kings in the world: ſo bountifully hath God dealt with mee, yet I muſt confeſſe, that the time was I could not conceiue of <hi>Happineſſe,</hi> at all, in <hi>this Life:</hi> which now I ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enioy, and ſo ſurely hold, as that I knowe all the powers of Hell ſhall neuer preuaile againſt me: oh how hard a thing was it to mee in former times, in blind times of my <hi>Ignorance:</hi> to be mooued to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:19262:83"/> it was exceeding harſh vnto me: but now bleſſed be God, I am ſo well acquainted with the rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in light, that if <hi>Repentance</hi> were againe to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, though it were a thouſand tlmes more difficult then it was, yet could I vndergoe it, for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which I doe already enioy: how much more for that fulneſſe of happineſſe, <hi>which I ſhall enioy in the Heauens?</hi> Neither doe I any longer meruaile as I haue done; why the Saints haue ſo willingly vndergone ſuch ſharpe and fiery trials as they haue done: yea, haue gloried in them, and accounted it all Ioy when they haue fallen into diuers trials; or, why the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and other Preachers of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> before and ſince haue cryed ſo earneſtly for <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> and doe daily prouoke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19262:84"/> and turne vnto God; For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they haue knowen, and do know perfectly, that ſuch a bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will followe, not onely in this Life, but in that which is to come. And to conclude, let me be heard amongſt my Countreymen. Sticke not at <hi>Repentance,</hi> what if it fill your hearts with ſorrow, your head with care, your eyes with teares, your chambers with complaints, yet I know, and you ſhall finde a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence euen here: yea, and a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereafter. The Lord open our eyes that we may ſee, and our eares that wee may heare, and our hearts that we may vnderſtand; for certainely this is trueth which is here laide downe, for the God of trueth hath ſpoken it in his owne wordes.</p>
